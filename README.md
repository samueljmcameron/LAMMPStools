# lammpstools

`lammpstools` is a small python package which can be used to analyse LAMMPS data.

For documentation on the functions it contains, install the package:

`pip install lammpstools`

open a python interpretter (by typing `python` in your shell)

and then in the python interpreter write

`import lammpstools`
`print(lammpstools.__doc__)`


which will give a list of all functions. To access documentation of a specific function,
follow a similar route. E.g. for the `DumpLoader` class write

`print(lammpstools.DumpLoader.__doc__)`

which will tell you (probably) all you need to know.
